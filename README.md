# Mui Clone

this is a "clone" of material ui using atomic-library-core.
it's a recreation of the most components

in this package you need to replace "variant" with "type" and "color" with "subType".
for instance  
```jsx
    <Btn type="filled" subType="primary">Click here</Btn>
    <Btn type="ghost" subType="success">Click here</Btn>
```

## components
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>component</th>
        <th>state</th>
        <th>description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Autocomplete</td>
        <td>Not yet</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Button</td>
        <td>replaced</td>
        <td>this component was replaced bt Btn</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Btn</td>
        <td>replaced</td>
        <td>this component was replaced bt Btn</td>
    </tr>
